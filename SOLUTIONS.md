# TAKE HOME CHALLENGE SOLUTION BREAK DOWN

This document provides an overview of the solutions for the various tasks in the challenge. Here is a detailed description of the tasks in the order they were completed:

## Task 1: Executing .md Files with Any Python Version

For the main task, I created a Python script, `run-with-version.py`, which allows users to execute Markdown files (.md) with any specified Python version within a Docker container. The script takes two command-line arguments: the path to the .md file to run and the Python version to use. The script ensures execution in an isolated Docker environment with the chosen Python version.

## Task 2: Adding Unit Tests for `run-with-version.py`

As an extra task, I added unit tests for the `run-with-version.py` script. This test covers various scenarios to verify the correct execution of Python, SQL, and Bash code snippets within Markdown files. The unit test helps ensure the reliability and correctness of the script.

To run the test use `pytest test_runner_python_sql_bash.py`

## Task 3: Fixing `test_runner_sqlite`

In response to the extra task, I addressed the issue in the test_runner_sqlite test case. This test previously faced a "database is locked" error, and I added the necessary modifications which is closing the connection after a transaction to resolve this issue . Now the test successfully runs and validates SQL code execution.

## Task 4: Improving Error Output in .md Files

For the fourth task, I improved the error output when running .md files. I enhanced the clarity and readability of error messages, making it easier for users to identify issues within their Markdown code snippets. I added a try-exception block and provided legible details on the error and tips to fix it. This improvement significantly improves the user experience when errors occur during execution.

## Task 5: Adding Support for Running Bash Snippets

As an extra task, I extended the `run-with-version.py` script to add support for running Bash code snippets. Users can now include Bash code in their Markdown files, and the script will execute them as subprocess commands, further enhancing the flexibility of the tool.

These solutions enhance the functionality and reliability of the codebase, ensuring that it can handle Python, SQL, and Bash code snippets within Markdown files while providing informative error messages when issues occur during execution. The tests implemented with Pytest help maintain the correctness of the code and facilitate future development and maintenance.

With these improvements, the codebase is better prepared to handle various code snippet types and provide a more user-friendly experience when dealing with errors.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I'm pleased to have completed the tasks in this challenge. These solutions enhance the functionality and reliability of the codebase, ensuring that it can handle Python, SQL, and Bash code snippets within Markdown files while providing informative error messages when issues occur during execution. The tests implemented with Pytest help maintain the correctness of the code and facilitate future development and maintenance.

I'd like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this challenge. If you have any further questions or require additional assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.
